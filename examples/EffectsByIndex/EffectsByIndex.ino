EffectsByIndex.ino

Cycles through the various effects supplied in the SevenSegmentSL1255 class, using
the effects_x(int index) method, repeatedly.

Demonstrates the methods:
  begin();
  effect_0(uint8_t);
  effect_0(uint8_t, int);
  effect_1(uint8_t);
  effect_1(uint8_t, int);
  effect_2(uint8_t);
  effect_2(uint8_t, int);
  effect_3(uint8_t);
  effect_3(uint8_t, int);

If you're unsure which pins to use to connect the seven segment display to on your
Arduino model, check the readme that came with this package or the documentation 
at https://github.com/greenonline/

This example code is in the public domain.
